										What do most of us associate with the likes of Bill Gates, Joe Flom and The Beatles? 
										<em>Genius</em> is likely one of them, <em>born lucky</em> possibly another. 
										Importantly, though, the superficial story we get told about such individuals is that they have managed to climb up 
										the ladder only through<em> individual merit</em>. 
										By extension, however, it implies that those who do not work hard enough will simply not make it. 
										The problem with this is that there are many people out there who put in the effort, yet they still don’t make it - they are not <em>lucky enough</em>. 
										The question is then, what do successful people, these so-called outliers, have that most people do not?&nbsp;
									</p>
									
									<p>
										Malcolm Gladwell explores this thought in <em>Outliers</em>. 
										Of course, their path to success is, in part, due to their exceptional talent but what truly 
										distinguishes their histories is because of their extraordinary opportunities. Starting with Bill Gates’s story, 
										in 1968, the mothers of the Lakeside School in Seattle, a school he was able to attend due to his wealthy upbringing, 
										took the $3000 from their rummage sale and bought a computer for its computer club. To put this into perspective, 
										most <em>universities </em>didn’t even have personal computers.
										This computer was a time-sharing terminal which made the act of programming consistently possible and enjoyable. 
										Given it was one of a handful of schools in the world to have access to this technology, 
										it’s sufficient to say that Bill Gates had a unique hands-on experience. 
										He also lived within walking distance of the University of Washington 
										which happened to have free computer time between three and six in the morning.
										Software companies in Seattle were desperately looking for programmers to work with their technology and thanks to the hours that Bill had racked up, 
										he was able to seize this opportunity immediately. 
										What do all of these opportunities have in common? 
										They gave Bill extra time to practice his computing skills. 
										By the time he dropped out of Harvard to start his software company, 
										Microsoft, he essentially accumulated seven years of <em>non-stop programming </em>at a time when such a technology was at its infancy!&nbsp;
									</p>
									
									<p>
										Malcolm also realised that most software entrepreneurs - Bill Gates, Paul Allen, 
										Steve Jobs, etc. - were born within a tight, three-year window (1954-1956). 
										While this may seem like a coincidence or possibly even insignificant at first glance, 
										it would turn out to be critical to their path to success. If you were too old in 1975, 
										you would likely take up a job at IBM straight out of university and would be difficult to leave this established,
										multi-billion dollar corporation while paying back your tuition and mortgage loan for an upcoming, 
										small software company like Microsoft. Conversely, if you were too young, you would also miss this train to some extent. 
										Bill Gates was born at the right time.
									</p>
									
									<p>
										It begs the question, what could all the people with limited opportunities do if 
										they were given greater opportunities?&nbsp;Putting his timeline into context, 
										we give birth to a much clearer picture of the path to success for Bill Gates. With a plethora of examples, 
										by the end of the book, you realise that the lesson is rather simple. Success is not self-made and 
										is not a simple function of individual merit. As Malcolm says, <em>it’s only by asking where they are from 
										that we can unravel the logic behind who succeeds and who doesn’t</em>.
