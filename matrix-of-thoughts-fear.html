										<em>I will never quit. Fear is a force that sharpens your senses. 
											Being afraid is a state of paralysis in which you can't do anything.</em>
									</p>
									
									<p>
										Marcus Luttrell crawled at snail-speed into the nearest cover along the Sawtalo Sar Mountains, 
										knowing he was the lone survivor and hunted by the hundreds of 
										Taliban fighters within his radius. Blood still poured out of 
										his legs like a fountain and bones were broken along his back and face; 
										his only survival tool was not his rifle in his hand, it was his <em>mind</em>. 
										The very same mind that pulled him through Navy SEALs’ Hell Week, the one that
										trained him to get back up every time he gets knocked over.&nbsp;
									</p>
									
									<p>
										I just cannot begin to fathom the state of <em>fear</em> 
										his mind was engraved in when he was out there all on his own. 
										But it was this fear-fuelled mind that navigated him forwards 
										in the search for help, rescue and even the most basic to human 
										survival: water. He was so dehydrated that his tongue was stuck 
										to the roof of his mouth. If his mind didn’t propel him forwards, 
										he would have eventually been found and killed by the Taliban; 
										likely not a slow one either. Ultimately, there was no choice other 
										than not quitting, drawing on every remaining ounce of strength and 
										accomplishing the mission.
									</p>
									
									<p>
										Although from a different perspective of a war battle, 
										I believe Dr. David Nott, in War Doctor, was guided 
										by the same force as Marcus. On his very first humanitarian mission, 
										he was deployed to Sarajevo in the middle of the Bosnian War.
										On one day, he recounts a young boy being rushed into the 
										hospital which he had to take care of. The kid had metal 
										fragments in his abdomen from one of the mortars and had 
										to be operated on immediately. As Dr. Nott began the incision, 
										an explosion went off at the hospital. The room turned pitch black.
										Moments later he realised his nurses and assistants on the operation 
										fled the operating theatre for cover while he was alone next to the kid, 
										which now had died. Dr. David was as vulnerable as any civilian trying 
										to survive the vicious conditions in his surroundings but he had the state of <em>mind</em> unlike 
										anyone else. A force strong enough to navigate you through life-and-death decisions.
									</p>
									
									<p>
										<em>Fear</em> to guide your strengths.
