										Have you ever wondered <em>how </em>your intelligence develops? Not from the context of 
										nature vs. nurture and how genetics influences this, rather from the perspective of your <em>physical brain</em>. 
										From intuition, we perceive intelligence as someone who may have a greater absolute number of 
										neurons or may be able to generate a deeper network of neurons. 
										However, I’ve never considered <em>how </em>the brain may work cohesively 
										to achieve this.&nbsp;
									</p>
									
									<p>
										I came across the Parieto-frontal integration theory which, as of now, 
										is the most widely accepted model for the biological basis of human intelligence. 
										In a 2007 paper by Jung and Haier, they proposed this theory as a direct review
									    of 37 different neuroimaging studies to examine the structural and functional correlates of intelligence. 
										[1] The model elucidates the critical interaction between the parietal and frontal cortices which, 
										when effectively linked by white matter structures in the brain, may explain human intelligence. 
										In other words, the structure, activity and connections between them varies between individuals 
										and is correlated with cognitive tasks.
									</p>
									
									<p>
										The flow of traffic can be broadly sequenced as the following: 
										(1) we process sensory information, (2) gets fed forward to the parietal cortex 
										for extraction and elaboration, (3) the parietal cortex interacts with frontal 
										regions to hypothesis test various solutions to a given problem, (4) once the best solution is arrived, 
										the anterior cingulate constraints response selection. 
										All of this is entirely dependent on the underlying white matter necessary to bring about
										rapid and error-free transmission of information.
									</p>
									
									<p>
										I further explored how the size of your cerebral cortex may influence human intelligence. 
										A paper by Hugo Schnack explains that the greater the developmental change of both cortical 
										thickness and cortical surface, the higher the intelligence. 
										[2] They explore this with great detail but in a nutshell, if an adolescent has 
										a higher rate of cortical thinning (and increasing cortical surface),
										the kid is likely to have higher intelligence. I find it fascinating that 
										the cerebral cortex is never completed but shows continuing intelligence-dependent development.&nbsp;
									</p>
									
									<p>
										It’s beautiful that this chemical chit-chat gives you your biological horsepower. 
										There are people who can think faster, more creative and exercise curiosity better than others;
										the process of which we briefly explored today.
										Note, however, that this doesn’t mean you should feel limited - it’s the opposite, in fact. 
										With today’s understanding, we should become more self-aware and proactive in the exploration of <em>the why</em>.
									</p>
									
									<p>
										Complacency limits your intellectual potential.
