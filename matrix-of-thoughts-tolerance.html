										I regularly listen to Nico Rosberg’s podcasts but there was one that particularly stood out 
										to me - one where he explained his philosophy that helped him win the 2016 championship.
										He simplified life, didn’t use social media and frequently meditated to calm his
										life situation down. Racing in a formula 1 car, battling against six times the 
										gravitational force when taking tight corners at unnaturally high speeds for hours 
										and doing this throughout the year is by all means not part of our evolutionary biology handbook.
										So, it seems logical that his philosophy is needed to gain that extra percent of capacity and clarity in those extreme moments. 
										He even said that when you’re in a race car and driving on the long straights, 
										you could apply meditation for a couple of seconds - simply a flick of a finger and you’re meditating.&nbsp;
									</p>
									
									<p>
										That is the ultimate form of meditation: bringing yourself back to the present mind when you want to. 
										I pondered over this concept for a while, trying to understand its simplicity amidst its complexity. 
										And with it came two observations. One, meditation and practicing mindfulness is not equal to being calm. 
										Two, evolutionary anxiety.
									</p>
									
									<p>
										To make sense of the first observation point, you need to understand that meditation, at its core, 
										is not about trying to feel more relaxed. It’s about understanding the mind and becoming more at ease with your mind. 
										If you approach meditation as such, the rest builds upon itself, naturally. 
										Controlling your thoughts, stopping them, changing your emotions - all of this is a battle you’ll never “win”.
										With centuries of evolution compact in your mind, we have only scraped the surface 
										of scientifically understanding how our minds work. All you can do is be present with 
										your mind and quietly observe its natural course of direction without commentary and judgement.
									</p>
									
									<p>
										That leads me onto the second observation, one that is a novice but complex development. 
										From an evolutionary perspective, Dr. Sonia Bishop from UC Berkeley said that fear is a response to 
										immediate threat while anxiety is a possibility of a long-term threat; we evaluate its probability, 
										severity and simulate ways to avoid it. As humans, we have a strong desire for absolute certainty and 
										if we cannot eliminate the risks that reside outside of our control, we become, understandably, irrational. 
										In the modern era, we “care” about our social media image, online acceptance, scrolling aimlessly and eternally; 
										a reality that shouldn’t turn virtual. When this world mixes with our evolutionary world, we become more irrational, 
										more insecure and more anxious. We are unable to assess the impact a possible long-term threat has on us.&nbsp;
									</p>
									
									<p>
										<em>Exercise a simpler life. Be present and don’t fight against your thoughts. </em>
