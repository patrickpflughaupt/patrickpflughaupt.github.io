										There comes a moment when ideas, trends and social behaviour cross a threshold and suddenly spread like an epidemic. 
										What does it take to reach this tipping point? 
										If there is one thing that we have learned from <i>Outliers</i>, 
										it is that your environment and background strongly influence your chances of “success” - or phrased differently, 
										your chances of reaching a tipping point.
									</p>

									<p>
										In his book The <i>Tipping Point</i>, Malcolm Gladwell explains that this phenomenon is governed by three fundamental principles. 
										The first principle is the <b>Law of the Few</b> which says that a few exceptional people 
										are capable of starting epidemics - the connectors, mavens and salesmen. 
										The connectors are highly social individuals capable of bringing together a vastly diversified group of people. 
										The mavens are the walking data banks - these individuals acquire a deep market knowledge 
										of particular products and services that people turn to for advice. 
										The salesmen display unparalleled exuberance and have a flair for influencing people’s choice for a particular product or service. 
										The second principle is the <b>Stickiness Factor</b> - what extra thing do you need to 
										include in your TV show or marketing campaign for it to stick in people’s minds? 
										The third principle is the <b>Power of Context</b> which says that to alter the context means to alter the result. 
										This was particularly evident in the rapid decline in crime rates in New York in the 80s and 90s - a section of the book I, truly, found fascinating. 
									</p>

									<p>
										On the surface, we saw (1) a decline in the illegal trade in crack cocaine and (2) the continued general aging of the population. 
										Both trends, however, are long-term changes that one would expect to have gradual effects, yet, in 1992, there were 2,154 murders and 626,182 
										serious crimes in NYC but within only five years, murders had <i>suddenly</i> dropped 64.3% and total crimes had fallen by almost half.
										A handful of economic and social indices do not simply cause crime rates to fall off the cliff - so, what was it? 
										The New York Transit Authority hired a new subway director by the name of David Gunn to rebuild the subway system who 
										was a strong advocate of the so-called <i>broken-windows theory</i>.
										He argued that if subways were cleaned of graffiti and windows were repaired, people would begin to obey the law.
										Trains would lay up over night in Harlem where a group of young kids would paint graffiti on the train.
										This work, however, extends over three days due to the paint layering process. 
										Thus, if all current and recent graffiti-painted trains were cleaned overnight, vandalizers would eventually lose motivation to pursue their act. 
										The act of vandalism was believed to be a signal of disorder that invited much more serious crimes.
										Along with arresting fare-beaters, the result was a drastic reduction in crime rates. 
										It made me realise that, indeed, small changes in life can have a compound effect. 
										Knowing this, I changed several personal habits with the view of exercising its compound effect, for example, reading 1-2 
										hours before going to bed <i>and</i> 1-2 hours after waking up. 
										Reading books that allow for (1) a different perspective of the world around us or (2) the pure inspiration through
										 (auto)biographies of <i>outliers</i> in our society - both of which keep my motivation afloat.
									</p>

									<p>
										The beauty of such books is that it opens a perspective of thinking I never knew existed and with Malcolm’s unique writing style, 
										I could not help to apply his way of thinking into previous books I have read. In fact, this is true for all principles 
										I have learned from both <i>The Tipping Point</i> and <i>Outliers</i>. 
										An excellent example is the life of Steve Jobs - the biography of whom I recently read. 
										There were a plethora of small moments that stood out to me as an early <i>tipping point</i> to the eventual success of Apple’s products. 
									</p>

									<p>
										Late 2000, Apple wanted to make a portable music player but with the technology available at the time, they only had a 
										suitable small LCD screen and a rechargeable lithium-polymer battery.
										The challenge, however, was to find a hard disk that was small enough to store a large number of songs on your portable device. 
										In February 2001, Jon Rubinstein of Apple, took one of his regular trips to Japan to visit their suppliers. 
										At the end of a meeting with Toshiba, they mentioned that they had developed hardware that they didn’t know what it would be useful for. 
										Rubinstein was introduced to a tiny, 1.8-inch drive that would hold 5GB of storage - an equivalent of a thousand songs. 
										Rubinstein knew exactly what he could use that technology for, and so on the very same night, he convinced Steve Jobs 
										to negotiate an agreement with Toshiba to have exclusive rights for these hard disks. 
										Later that year, when Jobs announced the iPod on stage, he would say that <i>this amazing little device holds a 
										thousand songs</i>, and it goes right in my pocket. 
										A critical tipping point for the iPod and yet, I wonder how many knew of this detail.
									</p>

									<p>
										In 1977, when Apple was still a company headquartered in Jobs’ parents’ garage and on the brink of bankruptcy, 
										Mike Marukkula went out of retirement to fund Apple to become a one-third owner. 
										While Steve Wozniak was building the Apple computer part-time while working full-time at HP, 
										Mike was the one who emphasised the importance of working with Apple full-time (Jobs later convinced Woz but it was Mike’s initiative). 
										Mike would eventually write up a one-pager called The Apple Marketing Philosophy categorised into three main pillars. 
										First was <b>empathy</b> - the product needs to emit emotions when used by the customer. 
										Second was <b>focus</b> - focus your efforts on a few products but make them the best. 
										Third was <b>impute</b> - he famously said to Jobs that people do judge the book by its cover so not only do 
										we need the best product of the highest quality, we need it to be perceived that way. 
										These principles would be iteratively emphasised throughout the 600+ pages in Jobs biography book.
										Steve Jobs was a true outlier but many of his decisions and actions were influenced by a few key individuals.
									</p>

									<p>
										If there is one thing that Malcolm has taught me through his books, it is that if you dig deep enough,
										you realise that the cause of some phenomenon is ubiquitous in our world.
										Indeed, there are exceptional people out there who are capable of starting epidemics. All you have to do is find them.
