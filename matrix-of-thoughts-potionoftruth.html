										<em>I am now convinced that Google searches are the most important dataset ever collected on the human psyche</em>, 
										wrote the author of <em>Everybody Lies</em>.&nbsp;
									</p>
									
									<p>
										Shiveringly revolting and sanguine were the two emotions that carefully balanced each other while I was reading this book.
										Through naivety, I have never considered exploring the huge collection of anonymous and aggregate data that the likes of Google, 
										Wikipedia, Facebook, Pornhub etc. have to offer. However, as I have come to terms with the deep opportunity that big data 
										science has over traditional reporting through surveys, I began to understand that these sources of data may well 
										be an unprecedented time in human history to fundamentally understand our <em>real</em> thoughts.&nbsp;
									</p>
									
									<p>
										In his book, Seth explains why big data offers greater insights into our minds. 
										First, these sources of data provide us with honest pieces of information that surveys simply cannot capture. 
										Second, it allows large-scale randomised controlled experiments at very little to no cost to identify correlations and possibly, causations. 
										Third, this wealth of information allows us to zoom in precisely on a small subset of people that would otherwise not be possible.&nbsp;
									</p>
									
									<p>
										Every page earns its purpose in juxtaposing the comforting lies that most of us assume and 
										unpleasant truths that are deeply hidden in these sources of data, some examples of which I would like to highlight. 
										<strong>Abortion</strong>: closing abortion clinics does not stop them, it simply leads to more self-induced 
										abortions. <strong>Child abuse</strong>: child abuse increases during economic downturns while government statistics 
										incorrectly show little change. <strong>Racism: </strong>searches for racist jokes rise about 30% on Martin Luther 
										King Day and regions that supported Donald Trump had the most searches for “nigger”. 
										<strong>Sex: </strong>More than 75% of searches of the form “I want to have sex with my ...” are incestuous. 
										Of course, this book offers many of such potions but with the sheer quantity of data, I interpret his findings 
										as an early indicator of a paradigm shift in understanding the modern human psyche.
									</p>
									
									<p>
										When I was younger, I frequently used the phrase <em>there’s always a little truth behind every ‘just kidding’</em>. 
										Not long ago, I would think that sites like Facebook and Instagram portray, on average, a false reality of a given person’s life. 
										Now, I think it’s more appropriate to say what Seth says in his book: <em>never compare your Google 
										searches to everyone else’s social media posts</em>.
