									<p>
										For as long as I can remember, reading books of any kind was at the very 
										bottom of my list of interests. Mariana Trench sort of bottom of list. 
										Why, I do not know, but things have changed this summer. I picked up 
										<em>Unnatural Causes </em>by Dr. Richard Shepherd and next thing you know, 
										I devoured seven additional medical biographies and watched Netflix’s Lenox 
										Hill, all within two months. A level of fascination for medicine and specialist 
										surgeons I could not translate into words. It always felt like a well choreographed 
										performance when experiencing the gruesome but immaculate detailed processes in operating theatres, 
										and yet I flinched when this exact process was shown on <em>Lenox Hill</em>. 
										I had to wait for <em>Do No Harm </em>by Dr. Henry Marsh to finally realise that I, too, found <em>its 
										controlled and altruistic violence deeply appealing</em>. 
										Although, at first, I was pulled back by this remark - altruism? 
										Yes, but violence? An oxymoron, surely? But with a bit of contemplation, 
										I came to terms with this strange, but perfectly efficient juxtaposition.&nbsp;
									</p>
									
									<p>
										Surgery is, no doubt, a dangerous sport. Deeply complicated procedures are carried 
										out in an attempt to prolong human life but with it comes a burden of responsibility, 
										and thus, risk. To master a skill, you need a never ending amount of practice, 
										trial and error, mistakes to learn from and risks to take to innovate medical practices. 
										And while lives are lost in the process of this, it is done for the greater good because 
										one day, when it is my turn to be practiced upon, I sincerely hope that the mastery of 
										their skill comforts me with the anaesthetic. Equally, if I become part of their statistics, 
										I know that I contributed to the knowledge of medical practices. <em>Altruistic violence.&nbsp;</em>
									</p>
									
									<p>
										To me, I was most drawn towards the practice of neurosurgery and the understanding of our brain.
										Not because of any interest in operating on this delicate piece, nor do I have any motivation 
										for this, but it feels like the Everest of medicine. It defines us, allows us to have hopes, 
										ambitions and experience emotions - love, anger, hate, joy, disgust, fear, grief. It allows 
										you to read and understand what I have translated from mere thoughts into words. The epitome 
										of art and science. We simply function because of a conglomeration of, as Dr. Henry put it, 
										electrochemical chatter of our nerve cells. However, while we have one hundred billion nerve 
										cells in our brains, we, frankly, don’t know too much about it. Does each one of the nerve 
										cells have a fragment of consciousness within it? How many of these do we require to be conscious 
										or to feel pain? Or does consciousness and thought reside in the electrochemical impulses 
										that join these billions of cells together? Questions raised in the book but we simply do 
										not have the answer to, yet.&nbsp;
									</p>
									
									<p>
										I really hope that generations from now, we will understand this 
										through perpetual research endeavours and altruistic violence.
