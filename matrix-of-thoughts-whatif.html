										What would happen if a hair dryer with continuous power were turned on and put in an airtight 1x1x1-meter box? 
										What would happen if you tried to hit a baseball pitched at 90% the speed of light? 
										What would happen if the Earth and all terrestrial objects suddenly stopped spinning, but the atmosphere 
										retained its velocity?&nbsp;
									</p>
									
									<p>
										At first, the assumption may be that these are improbable events, so why bother stirring up such comical, 
										but scientific questions? A perfectly plausible, albeit lifeless, 
										argument is that you are more likely to benefit from exercising your curiosity for practical purposes; 
										to allocate resources efficiently. Perhaps this is why Mark Twain said that <em>most of us die at 27, we just bury them at 72</em>.&nbsp;
									</p>
									
									<p>
										Plenty of studies have pointed out that children exercise their curiosity vastly differently in comparison to adults. 
										In fact, adults are very good at remembering information they are told to 
										focus on but ignoring the rest while children tend to pay attention to all the information that is presented to them. 
										The question is then, why do children distribute their attention more widely and sponge up more information?
										Most importantly, why do most of us lose this ability as we age - the ability to learn, unlearn and relearn;
										an intellectual rebellion?
									</p>
									
									<p>
										As the saying goes, when you start your new job, ask as many questions as you can in the first six months, 
										itâ€™s your golden ticket because no one expects anything from you, yet. 
										Most of the time, unfortunately, the quantity and quality of questions we ask 
										our colleagues around us at work plateaus off. But why? In our society,
										there is an approximately linear relationship between your working experience 
										and the knowledge you are expected to have, however, this is often accompanied with an ever decreasing rate of curiosity.
										Whether simple or complex by nature of a given question, we seem to be clouded by our social construct: an attitude to 
										preserve our public image that prevents us to be humble enough to question things. 
										To challenge the status quo. To have the boundless, exploratory mindset of a wondrous child.&nbsp;
									</p>
									
									<p>
										We are intimidated by the idea of challenging conventional, rule-written and foundational knowledge.
										Losing this ability comes at an, arguably, infinite cost - we stop exercising our curiosity.
									</p>
									
									<p>
										Question the things we take for granted, whether simplistic in nature or absurd hypothetical ones. 
										There may be naively-constructed questions or ill-phrased ones but every question keeps us moving forward, 
										opens new doors and allows us to explore new paths.
									</p>
									
									<p>
										There is no such thing as a dumb question.
